Write a function that given a number returns an array with a length of that number that contains the following:

* For each multiple of 3, "Fizz" instead of the number.
* For each multiple of 5, "Buzz" instead of the number.
* For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5, "FizzBuzz" instead of the number.

example:


```
>> fizzbuzz(5)
  => [1, 2, "Fizz", 4, "Buzz"]

>> fizzbuzz(20)
  => [1, 2, "Fizz", 4, "Buzz", "Fizz", 7, 8, "Fizz", "Buzz", 11, "Fizz", 13, 14, "FizzBuzz", 16, 17, "Fizz", 19, "Buzz"]
```
